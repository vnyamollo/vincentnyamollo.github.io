I'm a data scientist and MS student in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a passion for using data to understand human behavior and solve real-world problems. 
My current research focuses on driving behavior and risk factors among adults, combining data analysis with human factors insights to inform safer systems. 
I’m especially interested in applying machine learning, experimentation, and statistical modeling to uncover patterns, drive decisions, and build solutions that make a measurable impact.
